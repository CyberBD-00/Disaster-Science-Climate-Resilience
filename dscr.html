    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page dashboard design with three main sections: 'Overview', 'Curriculum Explorer', and 'About'. The 'Overview' uses charts to provide a high-level summary of credit distribution and thematic course breakdown, allowing for quick synthesis of the program's structure. The 'Curriculum Explorer' is the core interactive component, using semester-based navigation and accordion-style course details to allow users to progressively disclose information without being overwhelmed. An 'About' section provides foundational context. This structure was chosen to guide the user from a broad understanding to specific details in a logical, intuitive flow, prioritizing usability and exploration over a linear replication of the source document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Credits per Semester: Report Info -> Credit counts for each of 8 semesters. Goal -> Compare workload over time. Viz -> Bar Chart. Interaction -> Tooltip on hover shows exact credits. Justification -> Standard, clear method for comparing discrete categories. Library -> Chart.js. 2. Thematic Course Breakdown: Report Info -> All 70+ courses. Goal -> Organize and show program focus. Viz -> Donut Chart. Interaction -> Tooltip on hover shows theme and course count. Justification -> Effective for showing part-to-whole composition of the curriculum's focus areas. Library -> Chart.js. 3. Course Details: Report Info -> Detailed description for each course. Goal -> Inform on specific course content. Presentation -> Accordion UI. Interaction -> Click to expand/collapse. Justification -> Prevents information overload, allowing users to drill down as needed. Method -> HTML/CSS/JS. -->
